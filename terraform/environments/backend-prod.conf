# Production Backend Configuration
# Use: terraform init -backend-config=environments/backend-prod.conf
# 
# CRITICAL: Ensure these resources exist in your AWS account before deployment:
# - S3 bucket: treza-terraform-state-prod (with versioning and MFA delete enabled)
# - DynamoDB table: treza-terraform-locks-prod (with point-in-time recovery)
# 
# Create with: ./scripts/create-backend.sh prod
# RECOMMENDED: Use a different region from dev/staging for maximum isolation
# SECURITY: Consider using a separate AWS account for production
